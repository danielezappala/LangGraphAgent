# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on cleaning up and refactoring the existing codebase to eliminate redundant code, unused files, and overlapping functionality. The goal is to create a cleaner, more maintainable codebase with a single source of truth for each functionality, improved performance, and reduced complexity.

The current codebase has grown organically and contains multiple systems doing the same job, unused test files, redundant API endpoints, and overlapping frontend components. This refactoring will consolidate functionality while maintaining all existing features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Redundant Test and Development Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean project structure without unnecessary test files, so that I can focus on production code and avoid confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the backend directory THEN all redundant test server files SHALL be removed
2. WHEN examining simple HTTP servers THEN duplicate simple server implementations SHALL be eliminated  
3. WHEN checking test files THEN only essential test files SHALL remain
4. WHEN looking at the project structure THEN no development-only files SHALL be present in production code
5. WHEN running the application THEN all functionality SHALL work exactly as before

### Requirement 2: Consolidate Environment Variable Loading

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, consistent way to load environment variables, so that configuration is predictable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any module needs environment variables THEN it SHALL use a centralized loading mechanism
2. WHEN environment variables are loaded THEN there SHALL be no duplicate loading logic across files
3. WHEN the application starts THEN environment variables SHALL be loaded once and consistently
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN only one place SHALL need to be updated
5. WHEN debugging configuration issues THEN there SHALL be a single point of truth for env loading

### Requirement 3: Unify Provider Configuration System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a single provider configuration system, so that there's no confusion about which system is the source of truth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing providers THEN the database SHALL be the single source of truth
2. WHEN provider configuration is needed THEN only the database-first approach SHALL be used
3. WHEN validating provider configs THEN validation logic SHALL exist in only one place
4. WHEN initializing providers THEN there SHALL be one initialization mechanism
5. WHEN the legacy .env-based config system is removed THEN all functionality SHALL be preserved through the database system

### Requirement 4: Consolidate API Endpoints

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want clear, non-overlapping API endpoints, so that I know exactly which endpoint to use for each operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing provider configuration THEN there SHALL be only one set of API endpoints
2. WHEN the `/api/config` endpoints are removed THEN all functionality SHALL be available through `/api/providers`
3. WHEN testing provider connections THEN the logic SHALL exist in only one place
4. WHEN API documentation is generated THEN there SHALL be no duplicate or conflicting endpoints
5. WHEN frontend components make API calls THEN they SHALL use the consolidated endpoints

### Requirement 5: Merge Redundant Frontend Components

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consolidated React components without duplication, so that maintenance is easier and bundle size is smaller.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying provider status THEN there SHALL be one unified component handling all status display scenarios
2. WHEN showing conversation history THEN there SHALL be one component (not debug and production versions)
3. WHEN provider status hooks are used THEN there SHALL be no duplicate logic across components
4. WHEN components are rendered THEN all existing functionality SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN the bundle is built THEN the size SHALL be smaller due to eliminated duplications

### Requirement 6: Consolidate Backend Services

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want clear service boundaries without overlapping responsibilities, so that the code is easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN provider operations are needed THEN there SHALL be one service handling all provider CRUD operations
2. WHEN configuration validation is required THEN it SHALL happen in one centralized location
3. WHEN bootstrap/initialization is needed THEN there SHALL be one initialization service
4. WHEN services are imported THEN their responsibilities SHALL be clear and non-overlapping
5. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL work through the consolidated services

### Requirement 7: Clean Up Database Files

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a single, clear database file structure, so that data consistency is maintained and backup/restore is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN there SHALL be only one main database file for the application
2. WHEN checkpoint data is stored THEN it SHALL use a clearly designated database file
3. WHEN duplicate database files are removed THEN no data SHALL be lost
4. WHEN database migrations run THEN they SHALL target the correct, single database
5. WHEN backing up data THEN the database file structure SHALL be clear and predictable

### Requirement 8: Remove Unused Frontend Dependencies

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a clean package.json without unused dependencies, so that build times are faster and security surface is smaller.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining package.json THEN only used dependencies SHALL be present
2. WHEN unused packages are removed THEN the application SHALL build and run correctly
3. WHEN the bundle is analyzed THEN unused code SHALL not be included
4. WHEN security audits are run THEN there SHALL be fewer potential vulnerabilities from unused packages
5. WHEN new developers join THEN the dependency list SHALL be clear and purposeful

### Requirement 9: Clean Up Unused Imports and Code

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean files without unused imports or dead code, so that the codebase is easier to read and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining React components THEN all imports SHALL be used
2. WHEN reviewing TypeScript files THEN there SHALL be no unused variables or functions
3. WHEN running linting tools THEN there SHALL be no warnings about unused code
4. WHEN reading component files THEN the imports SHALL clearly indicate what the component uses
5. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN all functionality SHALL work exactly as before

### Requirement 10: Consolidate Configuration Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear, organized configuration file structure, so that environment setup is straightforward and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN the configuration file structure SHALL be clear
2. WHEN environment files are needed THEN there SHALL be no duplicate or conflicting files
3. WHEN configuration is changed THEN it SHALL be clear which file to modify
4. WHEN the application starts THEN configuration loading SHALL be predictable and documented
5. WHEN deployment happens THEN the configuration requirements SHALL be clearly defined
